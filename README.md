# Example for building Flexible UI Component Library with Build-Time Support for Multiple UI Frameworks


# Target 
- Have frontend library that support multiple ui libraries ( like <b> Material UI </b> and <b>React bootstrap</b>) at build time through use of enviroments variables 
- This project expose simple button componenet that can be created either with react or material ui

# How to run 
- In <b>frontend-lib </b> to build material ui version run <code>npm run buildMaterialUI</code> and to build react bootstrap version run <code> npm run buildBootstrap</code>
- In mainapp run <code>npm run start</code>

# How frontend-lib work 
- Based on passed enviroment variable <b> UIType </b> , webpack determines which library to include , and in the final bundle it includes only choosed ui library related packages
- To ensure all componenets in the different ui libraries use unified props we are including adapters for each ui library and so in this case if we changed ui library , it will not affect running projects using our components cause they use same props and in this case our change will be backward compatible for sure
